My project has a landing page with a profile picture, a short biography and a list of my skills. An additional page has been added to showcase current and future projects, and I have also added in placeholder links from the landing page for a 'books' and a 'hikes' page where I would like to showcase books I have read and hikes I have done in future.  In both the landing page and the projects page, I have put in a header menu allowing users to navigate to my information or the contact form on the header page, the projects page, and in future the additional hikes and books pages. The initial design of the project was based on wireframes, with a main page, a project page and a set of mobile-style designs created at the start of the project. 
#### Main Page Wireframe Design

A github repository was set up at the start of a project using the template: https://github.com/SheCodesAus/plus-portfolio-project-template, and a develop branch was set up for ongoing changes to be made.   

### Bonus (optional)
 Add a short paragraph describing the features below, if you included any. 
- [ ] Different styles for active, hover and focus states.
- [ ] Include JavaScript to add some dynamic elements to your site. (Extra tricky!)
