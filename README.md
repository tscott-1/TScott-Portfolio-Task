My project has a landing page with a profile picture, a short biography and a list of my skills. An additional page has been added to showcase current and future projects, and I have also added in placeholder links from the landing page for a 'books' and a 'hikes' page where I would like to showcase books I have read and hikes I have done in future.  In both the landing page and the projects page, I have put in a header menu allowing users to navigate to my information or the contact form on the header page, the projects page, and in future the additional hikes and books pages.  

### Bonus (optional)
 Add a short paragraph describing the features below, if you included any. 
- [ ] Different styles for active, hover and focus states.
- [ ] Include JavaScript to add some dynamic elements to your site. (Extra tricky!)
